suggestions for improvement:
- The code could be slightly improved in terms of readability by adding a few more comments, especially in the `get_short_info` method to explain the logic behind pluralization.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code perfectly implements all the requirements outlined in the Chapter Content/Questions.  It correctly creates the Farm class, implements the `__init__`, `add_animal`, `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info` methods. The output matches the example provided, and the bonus features are implemented correctly.  All aspects, including class creation, dictionary usage, string formatting, methods, list manipulation and sorting, and conditional logic are accurately implemented.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable and method names are descriptive. The use of f-strings enhances readability.  However, a few comments within `get_short_info` could further improve understanding of the pluralization logic.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient.  The algorithm used for adding animals and generating the output strings has a time complexity that is linear with respect to the number of animals, which is quite efficient.  No unnecessary computations are performed.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the code.  It only deals with string manipulation and dictionary operations; no external data is accessed, making it inherently secure.
