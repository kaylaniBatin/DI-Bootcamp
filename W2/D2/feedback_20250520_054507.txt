suggestions for improvement:
- Add handling for empty item lists in `__str__` to avoid errors.
- The `last_page()` method could be slightly improved to handle the edge case of an empty list more elegantly.  Currently, it correctly sets `current_idx` to 0 for an empty list; however, a comment explaining this behavior might improve readability.
- Consider adding a `get_current_page` method for better clarity and encapsulation. This method would simply return `self.current_idx + 1`.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements the `Pagination` class as specified in the Chapter Content/Questions.  All methods (navigation, item retrieval, string representation) function as described. The exception handling in `go_to_page` is also correct. The only minor deviation is the lack of explicit handling of an empty item list in `__str__`, which could lead to a silent failure instead of a more informative error or empty string.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Method names are descriptive, and the code follows good Python conventions. However, adding a comment to explain the empty list edge case in `last_page` would further enhance readability.  Consider adding a helper method for repetitive calculations (e.g., determining start and end indexes).
- performance: The code's performance is optimal for the given task.  List slicing is efficient for retrieving page items, and the algorithm's time complexity is linear with respect to the number of items.
- security: The code is secure; it includes proper exception handling to prevent common issues like accessing an invalid index. No vulnerabilities or security risks were detected. The `go_to_page` method handles out-of-range inputs correctly raising a ValueError.
